# lethal-challenges
Lethal Company + Town of Salem type inspired roles.

Not good at frontend, so it is quite hideous to look at. But the functionality is there.

The idea is that a gamemaster logs in via the default route and he or she can start the game and delegate the roles to players.
No role will be delegated to more than 1 player at a time.
Players can try and guess each others roles. If it is correct, they gain a point and lose one at an incorrect guess. You cannot guess more than once per role delegation.
We usually change roles every day or per quota. Some roles are quota specific, but these can be removed.

The project is based on a google docs document that my friend send to me:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZXU5eIKh23qYgdCOR6bsSpuAp57SBb4vRsjG0xlqPOQ/edit

Change the code to your liking and have fun. I did not include code for kicking players, as this was thought to be something to do with friends.
I hosted the code on glitch.com and passed the link using the /game route to my friends and the default route for the gamemaster.
